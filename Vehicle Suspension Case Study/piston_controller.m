%Devise a state feedback controller that uses sensor readings from the
%vehicle to decide how much force to exert on it. Remember that the piston
%has a minimum length of 5 cm and a maximum length of 17 cm.

function force = piston_controller(piston_length, body_velocity, body_acceleration)


force = 0;
