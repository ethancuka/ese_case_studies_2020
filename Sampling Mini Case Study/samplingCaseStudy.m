%% Sampling and undersampling




%% Interpolation
% The lowsample variable in the workspace is a timeseries representing a
% signal sampled at its Nyquist Rate of 20 Hz. The highsample variable is
% the same signal sampled at 200 Hz. Your goal for this case study is to
% interpolate the signal with the lower sample rate using the
% Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula provided in the case study
% document. You can compare your work to the highsample signal to see how
% you did.
